Cool idea, but it kills your crew members and kills all the monsters on any world you beam down to.

The errors it returns are:

```
[Error] Exception while calling script init: (LuaException) Error code 2, [string "/monsters/monster.lua"]:30: attempt to index a nil value (global 'BData')
[Error] Exception while calling script init: (LuaException) Error code 2, [string "/npcs/bmain.lua"]:31: attempt to index a nil value (global 'BData')
```

If you want to edit your player file, you should be able to resurrect your crew.
